    Description:

        In this file, we define functions for PID control.
        This class would be a template for both position and velocity control.
        The control functions need to accept the reference signal, the actual signal, and also PID parameters as arguments.
        PID global variables such as the error, integral, and derivative terms should be defined and stored in the PID class.
        So in the main ino file, we need to first define and initialize the PID class, then call the control functions in the loop.
        
        When implementing this class, you should also include the actions.h file, 
        as you will need to read and modify the global variables defined in actions.h.
        See actions.h for more details.
