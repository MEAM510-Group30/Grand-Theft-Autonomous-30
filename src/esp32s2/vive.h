/*
    Description:
    
        In this file, we define the functions that are used to read the encoder sensor data connected to the ESP32-S2.

        The two vive sensors tell the position and orientation of the robot, float type would be good.
        There are already sample code on canvas for the vive sensors, we may modify them to fit our needs.
