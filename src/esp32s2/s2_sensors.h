/*
    Description:
    
        In this file, we define the functions that are used to read the sensor data connected to the ESP32-S2.
        Sensors include two motor encoders, two vive sensors, and all the static IR photosensors.

        The encoders are bidirectional Hall action encoders.

        The two vive sensors tell the position and orientation of the robot, float type would be good.
        There are already sample code on canvas for the vive sensors, we may modify them to fit our needs.

        For the photosensors, we hope to tell the approximate direction of the trophies using data from all the static IR photosensors, 
        so there should be a function that calculates this.
